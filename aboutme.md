### Education:

* Ph.D., Astrophysical Sciences, Program in Plasma Physics, Princeton University (2014)
* B.S., Engineering Physics, Cornell University (2008)

### Path
Interest in clean energy and concern about climate change led me to pursue fusion.  From there I discovered the wide world of plasma physics and the myriad challenges and wonders of this branch of science.

After my undergraduate and graduate studies, I completed a postdoc at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), in the magnetic fusion theory group within the Fusion Energy Sciences Program under PLS/Physics division.  Following the postdoc, I stayed on as a research scientist at LLNL.
