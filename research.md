### Zonal Flow
Zonal flow presents a fundamental challenge to understand how regular, coherent patterns can form out of turbulence.

#### Pattern Formation
Nonlinear physics is hard.  Anyone with an even minor interest

#### Wave kinetic theory and geometrical-optics approach

I realized that a widely used formalism for studying zonal flow ended up being mathematically pathological.  That formalism, a particular wave-kinetic equation (WKE) for drift-wave fluctuations combined with an evolution equation for zonal flow, had been used to give linear growth rates.  But when used directly as a nonlinear model, it generates arbitrarily small scales, a clearly unphysical behavior.  In the same article, I provided a better wave-kinetic equation, which I referred to as a new geometrical-optics (GO) approximation.  I derived the better-behaved CE2-GO model, and showed that it sits as an intermediate physics model between CE2 and the pathological WKE.  CE2-GO is theoretically appealing because the long-wavelength approximation renders the equations *local* in the phase space. (This paper has the surely rare distinction of having an affiliation of Stanford Law School.  That's another story.)

In a follow-up work, Daniel Ruiz, myself, Eric Shi, and Ilya Dodin recast the physics content of CE2 into an equivalent mathematical set using the Wigner-Moyal formalism.  This was a nice piece of work because in earlier work I had mentioned that the Wigner-Moyal equation, familiar from quantum mechanics, must be equivalent, but it had never been shown explicitly.  The phase-space coordinates of the Wigner-Moyal equation can be somewhat more intuitive, and have a more natural reduction for geometrical-optics approximations.  Ilya Dodin's group at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has since continued to study zonal flow and drift waves with the Wigner-Moyal approach. (The papers from Dodin's group used the alternate name "improved wave-kinetic equation" for CE2-GO)

To test the fidelity of CE2-GO and whether it would actually be a useful model for further fundamental studies of zonal flow, I numerically simulated it and compared with direct quasilinear simulations.  While the energy partition between fluctuations and zonal flow are correctly captured in CE2-GO, the scale length of the nonlinearly saturated zonal flow is not correctly recovered by CE2-GO.  This suggests that, unfortunately, some physics and instabilities that determine the zonal flow size could not be studied in the CE2-GO framework.

#### Equivalence of the secondary instability and the zonostrophic/modulational instability
There have been various approaches to understand the formation of zonal flow.  Two approaches had been the secondary instability and the zonostrophic or modulational instability.  These approaches

### Neoclassical Transport Theory
I spent a summer at MIT working on neoclassical transport theory.  One product of that was a standard drift-ordered calculation of neoclassical transport using the full Landau collision operator via a particular basis expansion that worked rather well.  I also worked on how neoclassical transport coefficients are modified in a tokamak pedestal, where the radial electric field can be large enough to modify particle orbits.
